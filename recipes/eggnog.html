    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Soft Custard</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs, slightly beaten</li>
        <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>Dash salt</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Eggnog</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whipping cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        <li>1/2 cup light rum</li>
        <li>1 or 2 drops yellow food color, if desired Ground nutmeg</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In 2-quart heavy saucepan, stir eggs, granulated sugar and salt until well mixed. Gradually stir in milk. Cook over medium heat 10 to 15 minutes, stirring constantly, until mixture just coats a metal spoon; remove from heat. Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla. Place saucepan in cold water until custard is cool. (If custard curdles, beat vigorously with hand beater until smooth.) Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours but no longer than 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Just before serving, in chilled medium bowl, beat whipping cream, powdered sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla with electric mixer on high speed until stiff. Gently stir 1 cup of the whipped cream, the rum and food color into custard.</li>
        <li>Pour custard mixture into small punch bowl. Drop remaining whipped cream in mounds onto custard mixture. Sprinkle with nutmeg. Serve immediately. Store in refrigerator up to 2 days.</li>
